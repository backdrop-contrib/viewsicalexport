# Views iCal Export

This module enables you to export iCal feeds (also known as vcalendar) from views, using the
"iCal Feed" and "iCal Fields" views plugins.

The most typical use case is a view with event nodes (any content type with date fields). 
Using this module, you can attach an iCal feed to your views' page, so visitors are able
to subscribe to your events via their calendars.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

## Dependencies

Two Backdrop modules are required, both come with Backdrop core:

* views
* date

## Current maintainers

* Indigoxela (https://github.com/indigoxela)

## Credits

This module is a complete rewrite of the [Date iCal](https://www.drupal.org/project/date_ical) Drupal module.
Unlike Date iCal it doesn't require external libraries, but it has of course less features.

Date iCal was initially written by [Karen Stevenson](https://www.drupal.org/u/karens), for a long time
maintained by [coredumperror](https://www.drupal.org/u/coredumperror) and ported to Backdrop
by [John Franklin](https://github.com/jlfranklin).
So the original module, Views iCal Export has been derived from, is also available for Backdrop.
