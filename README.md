# Views iCal Export

This module enables you to export iCal feeds (also known as vcalendar) from views, using the
"iCal Feed" and "iCal Fields" views plugins.

A typical use case is a view from event nodes (any content type with date fields). 
Using this module, you can attach an iCal feed to your views' page, so visitors are able
to add your events to their calendar and get them updated automatically.

## Credits

This module is a complete rewrite of the [Date iCal](https://www.drupal.org/project/date_ical) Drupal module.

Date iCal was initially written by [Karen Stevenson](https://www.drupal.org/u/karens), for a long time
maintained by [coredumperror](https://www.drupal.org/u/coredumperror) and ported to Backdrop
by [John Franklin](https://github.com/jlfranklin).
So the original module, this one has been derived from, is also available for Backdrop.
