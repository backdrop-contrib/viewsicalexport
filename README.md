# Views iCal Export

This module enables you to export iCal feeds (also known as vcalendar) from views, using the "iCal Feed" and "iCal Fields" views plugins.

The most typical use case is a view with event nodes (any content type with date fields). 
You attach an iCal feed to your views' page, so visitors are able to subscribe to your events via their calendars.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

## Dependencies

## Credits

This module is a complete rewrite of the Date iCal Drupal module.
Unlike Date iCal it doesn't require external libraries, but it has of course less features.

Date iCal was initially written Karen Stevenson (https://www.drupal.org/u/karens), for a long time maintained 
by coredumperror (https://www.drupal.org/u/coredumperror) and ported to Backdrop by John Franklin (https://github.com/jlfranklin).
